# Postman collection for Typesense

Calling Typesense API via `curl` commands on your terminal can be a bit cumbersome.

Thankfully, we've put together a <a href="typesense.postman_collection.json" download="/typesense.postman_collection.json">Postman collection</a> that you can use and share with your team. We'll also be happy to accept any changes or improvements -- send us a PR!

In case you're not familiar with Postman, here's a quick walk-through on importing and using this collection.

## Import the collection

Downloaded the [Postman collection](typesense.postman_collection.json), and import it into Postman.

You should now be able to see the collection on the left sidebar.

## Import the environment

We have also provided a [Postman Environment](/typesense.postman_environment.json) -- you need to import that as well.
